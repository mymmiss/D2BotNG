/// Counting is why a group aggregates rather than simply AND-ing: each condition's branch is
/// DISTINCT per item, so UNION ALL across the branches then GROUP BY item id makes COUNT(*)
/// exactly "how many conditions this item satisfied", and min_matches falls out as a HAVING.
///
/// A malformed request is REJECTED, never repaired — see <see cref="Validate" />. Quietly
/// dropping a bound or clamping a count turns "this filter is wrong" into "here are results",
